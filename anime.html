                Anime is hand-drawn and computer-generate animation originating in Japan. However, in Japan and
                in Japanese, anime describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation
                with a
                similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature
                themes
                and artsyles that can be considered as "anime"<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the
                1960s with
                the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic
                audience.
                Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the
                Internet.
                In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or
                video
                games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent
                technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative
                and
                individualistic techniques. Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on
                movement,
                and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle
                shots.[3]
                Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common
                characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios such as Studio
                Ghibli,
                Kyoto Animation, Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, Wit Studio, CoMix Wave Films, Production I.G, and Toei
                Animation. Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of
                foreign
                dubbed, subtitled programming, and since the 2010s its increasing distribution through streaming
                services and a
                widening demographic embrace of anime culture, both within Japan and worldwide. As of 2016, Japanese
                animation
                accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.<br>

                The series that stands tall as the father of modern shounen anime – “Dragon Ball.” Created by Akira
                Toriyama, this iconic franchise has left an indelible mark on the anime industry. Since its debut in
                1984, both the manga and anime series have exerted an unparalleled influence on the shounen genre.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dragon Ball’s unique blend of adventure, martial arts, comedy, and sci-fi crafted a formula that set the
                mold for many action series to come. There are several key reasons Dragon Ball deserves to be called the
                progenitor of modern shounen storytelling.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The series put great emphasis on “power levels” and sensing the strength of energy auras like Ki
                    around the body.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This quantified approach to measuring fighting prowess became inextricably linked to the shounen
                    genre.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Goku’s relentless pursuit of strength and the way he overcame seemingly insurmountable challenges
                    set the foundation for subsequent shounen heroes to push their limits and achieve new levels of
                    power.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From the menacing King Piccolo to the extraterrestrial tyrant Frieza, the series showcased epic
                    battles and adversaries that truly enticed fans.
