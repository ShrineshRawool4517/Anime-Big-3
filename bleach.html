            <p>Bleach is a Japanese anime television series based on Tite Kubo's original manga series of the
                same name. It was produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired on TV Tokyo
                from
                October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. The story follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki
                after he
                obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul
                Reaper,
                Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits
                and
                guiding departed souls to the afterlife. In addition to adapting the manga series it is based on, the
                anime
                periodically includes original self-contained storylines and characters not found in the source
                material.</p>

                The series adapts Kubo's manga with the main story arcs and introduces anime exclusive ones. In Karakura
                Town, high school student Ichigo Kurosaki becomes a substitute Soul Reaper (死神, Shinigami, literally,
                "Death God"), when Rukia Kuchiki risks her life to protect him from a Hollow. Although initially
                reluctant to accept his responsibility, he takes her place, and during this time they discover that a
                few classmates are spiritually aware and have their own powers: Quincy survivor Uryū Ishida uses
                spiritual particles, Orihime Inoue has a group of protective spirits called Shun Shun Rikka and Yasutora
                Sado ("Chad") has strength equal to the Hollows encased in his arm.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Rukia is sentenced to death for transgressions in the human world and sent to the Soul Society,
                Ichigo meets Kisuke Urahara and Yoruichi Shihōin, the duo of exiled Soul Reapers. They allow him and his
                friends to save Rukia. After this, it is revealed that ex-squad captain Sōsuke Aizen framed Rukia for
                the crime and has been illegally experimenting on Soul Reapers and Hollows. Aizen plans to conquer the
                Soul Society by using the Hōgyoku, a legendary powerful substance turning Hollows into half Soul
                Reapers. After faking his death and his reappearance caused a fight with some people, Aizen escapes into
                Hueco Mundo, the realm of Hollows, and later kidnaps Orihime as she is instrumental in creating the
                Oken, a power that will allow him to kill the Soul King, the ruler of the Soul Society.

            <p>
                After being trained by the Vizards, other exiled Soul Reapers and the victims of Aizen's experiment,
                Ichigo and his friends travel into Hueco Mundo. Facing a group of Arrancars, who are Hollows given Soul
                Reaper abilities, led by an elite group known as the Espadas, which are composed of ten Arrancars with
                exemplary strength. Espadas serve as commanders in Aizen's army and each has the factions of weaker
                Arrancars. Along with Aizen, Gin Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen, the Espada as a group possess comparable
                strength to Soul Reaper captains. After rescuing Orihime, Aizen reveals her kidnapping was a distraction
                to allow him to take Karakura Town, as its spiritual energy is what is needed for the Oken. After being
                trained by his father Isshin, another exiled Soul Reaper, Ichigo sacrifices his power to seal Aizen away
                when the Hōgyoku rejects its master, and the Soul Reapers defeat the Espadas.

                Months later, Chad and the members reveal themselves as Fullbringers in a group called Xcution. They can
                give up their powers to restore other ones and they plan on doing so for Ichigo, who uses the power of
                Fullbringer. However, it is all a ruse by their leader Kugo Ginjo, a Fullbringer and former Substitute
                Soul Reaper, to extract his powers and empower all of them. Ichigo has his Soul Reaper powers restored,
                when he gains his trust from the Soul Society. After helping other Soul Reapers defeat Ginjo's team,
                Ichigo resumes his duty as a Substitute Soul Reaper.</p>

                Several anime exclusive story arcs are introduced in the series. The first arc focuses on the Bount,
                a group of spiritual humans who are immortal longer by stealing souls. Their leader, Jin Kariya, seeks
                to destroy the Soul Society in revenge. However, Ichigo and his allies defeat them. The second arc
                focuses on Shūsuke Amagai, a Soul Reaper captain replacing Ichimaru. Amagai seeks revenge against
                Captain Yamamoto for the death of his father and uses the clan's forbidden experiment. However, Amagai
                realizes his mistake and kills himself. The third arc features the evil Zanpakutō spirit Muramasa, who
                turns itself and other ones into spiritual beings to take revenge on the Soul Society for imprisoning
                its master Kōga Kuchiki. After succeeding, he is double-crossed and transforms into a monstrous creature
                that Ichigo defeats, but after Muramasa reveals the intention was to have Soul Reapers and Zanpakutō
                communicate on equal terms. The fourth and final arc features an event in which Kagerōza Inaba creates
                modified copies of all Soul Reapers in Reigai bodies. He attempts to fuse with Nozomi Kujō into an
                original being Ōko Yushima. However, Nozomi sacrifices herself to defeat Inaba and Ichigo loses his
                power.
